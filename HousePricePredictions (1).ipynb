        "For this project, I decided to try my hand at a more advanced regression technique and generate a random forest regression model to predict house prices based on 79 explanatory variables. The training and test data came from the \"House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques\" Kaggle competition at https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data. \n",
        "\n",
        "Random forest regression is part of the sklearn data science tool ensemble. Using the random forest regression tool kit is surprisingly simple once the input data has been properly cleaned and processed. Random forest regression is a tree-generating machine learning technique that can be used for both regression and classification problems. Random forest algorithms are purported to avoid overfitting through the use of statistical averaging, and typically result in very short learning times. The random forest regression tool gets its' name from the mulitple decision trees that it generates (one might call it a forest of trees!). After the model has produced a series of decision tress based on a bootstrap-like sampling of the data, test input is delivered to the model and the algorithm determines the most likely outcome based on the averaged decision of each tree that was generated during the fit. \n",
        "\n",
        "Random forest regression and/or classification is commonly regarded as an accurate technique for efficiently processing large data sets, and is also considered quite robust in handling data sets with a lot of missing information. The random forest model searches for \"high-gain\" predictors at the initial stages of the fitting process, searching for predictors that result in the greatest improvement in predicting classification or regression outcomes. Since the house price data is essentially a list of house characteristics associated with a price tag, this decision tree model seemed like a natural first choice. \n"

        "\n",
        "Although the sklearn random forest algorithm is an exciting and somewhat new concept, it may not be the best tool for the job. The Sklearn random forest hyperparameter tuning process is a very time and memory intensive process (taking approximately 223.3 minutes to execute). Tuning the parameters of the random forest regressor model resulted in only a modest improvement over the previous submission, tipping my score up to .60522 from 0.60940 (a lower value means higher predictive accuracy), this was a disappointing improvement in performance for the time spent retraining the model. Given the large number of factors and data points in this set, it is difficult to know what model(s) would achieve the highest level of performance. Both forward and backward model selection presented significant challenges in predicting a data set of this size after my first submission. Not the least of which that ols would not operate if given 79 parameters, making backward selection essentially impossible and forward selection exceedingly difficult to organize.\n",
        "\n",
        "If I had to attempt this competition again (which I may) I would develop an algorithm to automate a forward selection regression model. This automation seems necessary given the large number of factors and points in the data set, as well as the confusion that inevitably results from keeping the forward-selection process organized. \n",
        "\n",
        "I found this competition to be particularly challenging since I could not assess the test fit of my models prior to submission (no answer to the test set is given). Not having this information made it impossible to assess if my model was overfitted on the training data. The process of designing a predictive model could be improved by incorporating additional data sets to train and test on. \n",
        "\n",
        "I learned a lot about random forest algorithms during this project. It appears that this tool is becoming very popular in machine learning concepts such as motion sensing and object classification. This particular problem set may not have been the best match for RFR, however. "
